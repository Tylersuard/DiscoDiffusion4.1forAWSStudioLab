# DiscoDiffusion4.1forAWSStudioLab
DiscoDiffusion 4.1 for AWS StudioLab

## Instructions:
1. Create account on AWS StudioLab: https://studiolab.sagemaker.aws
2. Get a GPU runtime up and running
3. Create a folder called "content" in your root folder
4. Upload this .ipynb file to that folder
5. Set parameters, enter prompts, and run all!

Note: this notebook allows you to enter more than one prompt.  The program will loop through all the prompts, so you can set a list of images to create and then walk away and come back later to a full gallery of AI-generated art!  All images are stored in the image output folder.
